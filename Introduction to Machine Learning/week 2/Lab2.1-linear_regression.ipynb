    "Taxi trip records include id, vendor_id, pickup_datetime, passenger_count, store_and_fwd_flag, trip_duration, distance_km.\n",

    "Data in Machine Learning and Deep Learning is usally consisting of `train` and `test` splits. Sometimes there's a `validation` split as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of the train-test split is to assess how well a machine learning model generalizes to unseen data. By splitting the dataset, we can train the model on one subset of the data (the training set) and test its performance on another subset (the test set).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Train test split usually serves two purposes:\n",
    "1.   **Avoiding Overfitting**: By using a separate test set, we ensure that the modelâ€™s performance is not overly optimistic, as it has not seen the test data during training. This helps to avoid overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data\n",

    "2.   **Model Validation**: It provides a straightforward way to validate the model, giving insights into how it might perform in real-world scenarios\n",
