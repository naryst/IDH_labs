    "## Task\n",
    "It is often necessary to classify data in machine learning algorithms. Each data object is represented as a vector (a point) in p-dimensional space (a sequence of numbers). Each of these points belongs to only one of two classes. We are interested in whether we can divide the points by a hyperplane of dimension \"p-1\". This is a typical case of linear separability. There can be many such hyperplanes. Therefore, it is natural to believe that maximizing the gap between classes contributes to more confident classification. That is, can we find a hyperplane such that the distance from it to the nearest point is maximized. This would mean that the distance between the two closest points lying on opposite sides of the hyperplane is maximized. If such a hyperplane exists, we will be most interested in it, it is called the optimal separating hyperplane, and the linear classifier corresponding to it is called the optimal separating classifier.\n",
