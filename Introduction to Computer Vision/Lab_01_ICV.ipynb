        "Computer Vision is the science of building artificial systems that can process and interpret visual data, mainly images and videos. Today, people using their phones are constantly creating visual data. For example, hundreds of millions of images/videos are uploaded on Instagram every day. A human would need years to review the images/videos uploaded on Instagram in a single day. Hence, we donâ€™t have the human manpower to deal with such huge amounts of visual data. It is very important to build algorithms that can understand this visual data much faster than a human.\n"
