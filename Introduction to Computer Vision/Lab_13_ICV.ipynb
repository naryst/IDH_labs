        "**Multi-Class Object Detection and Localization:**\n",
        "- Multi-class object detection and localization involve identifying multiple objects of different classes within an image and determining their precise locations.\n",
        "- This task extends single object detection by incorporating the ability to handle multiple instances of different classes simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):**\n",
        "- CNNs are highly effective for image-related tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies through convolutional layers.\n",
        "- For multi-class object detection and localization, CNN architectures are modified to include outputs for both class probabilities and bounding box coordinates.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Modifications to CNN Architecture:**\n",
        "1. **Output Layer Adjustments:**\n",
        "   - The output layer should predict class probabilities for each object in the image and bounding box coordinates \\((x, y, w, h)\\).\n",
        "   - This can be achieved by having separate outputs for classification and bounding box regression.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Loss Function:**\n",
        "   - A custom loss function that combines classification loss (e.g., categorical cross-entropy) and localization loss (e.g., mean squared error) is used to train the model.\n",
        "   - The classification loss ensures accurate class predictions, while the localization loss ensures precise bounding box predictions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Dataset Requirements:**\n",
        "- The dataset should contain images with multiple instances of objects from different classes.\n",
        "- Each image should be annotated with bounding boxes and class labels for all objects present.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Training and Evaluation:**\n",
        "- The model is trained on a dataset with annotated bounding boxes and class labels.\n",
        "- Evaluation metrics include the accuracy of object classification and the precision of bounding box predictions, often measured using metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU).\n",
