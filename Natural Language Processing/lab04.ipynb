estimating the probabilities of these n-grams, we can build robust models for various NLP tasks such as text generation, speech recognition, and machine translation. \n","- Understanding and implementing n-grams is essential for creating systems that can effectively interpret and generate human language, forming the foundation for more advanced NLP techniques and applications. As we move forward, mastering these basic concepts will empower us to tackle more complex challenges in the field of natural language processing.\n","\n","> As we delve deeper into the complexities of language, n-grams serve as a stepping stone to more advanced models, such as neural networks and transformers. Mastering n-grams provides a solid foundation for understanding how machines can process and generate human language."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"databundleVersionId":7686177,"sourceId":70220,"sourceType":"competition"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30646,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.8"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
