        "\n",
        "BPE is a technique used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for subword tokenization. Unlike traditional tokenization that splits text into individual words, BPE breaks down text into smaller units considering the vocabulary size and morphology of the language. This approach can be particularly beneficial when dealing with large vocabularies or rare words. The algoritghm:\n",
        "1. Initial vocabulary: BPE starts with the individual characters in the text as the initial vocabulary.\n",
        "2. Merging frequent pairs: it iteratively analyzes the training text and identifies the most frequent pair of characters or subwords (considering existing merged units).\n",
        "3. Replacing pairs: this most frequent pair is replaced with a new symbol not present in the vocabulary. The new symbol represents the merged subword.\n",
        "4. Vocabulary update: the vocabulary is updated to include the newly created symbol.\n",
        "5. Repeat: steps 2-4 are repeated for a predefined number of iterations or until a desired vocabulary size is reached.\n",
        "\n",
        "Applications:\n",
        "- Machine translation: for effective handling vocabulary differences between languages\n",
        "- Text classification and summarization: BPE proves a richer representation of words and captures morphological information\n",
        "- Large Language Models (LLMs): BPE allowes LLMs to handle the vast vocabulary encountered in real-world text data\n",

        "In this lesson basic text preprocessing techniques were considered. We've explored a range of fundamental methods that serve as the building blocks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks:\n",
        "    \n",
        "- **Sentence** Segmentation: We delved into the art of dividing text into meaningful units – sentences. This crucial step allows us to analyze the structure and meaning within each sentence.\n",
        "- **Lowercasing**: By converting all text to lowercase, we ensure consistency and facilitate comparisons between words, streamlining various NLP processes.\n",
        "- **Stop Word Removal**: We tackled the challenge of high-frequency, uninformative words (stop words) by filtering them out. This step helps focus on the core meaning of the text and improves the performance of NLP models.\n",
        "- **Lemmatization**: We explored the concept of reducing words to their base or dictionary forms (lemmas). This technique enhances consistency and allows us to capture the core meaning regardless of inflectional variations.\n",
        "- **Stemming**: As an alternative to lemmatization, we investigated stemming, which reduces words to their base forms but might not always result in actual words. Stemming offers a balance between efficiency and accuracy.\n",
        "- **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)**: We ventured into the world of subword units by exploring BPE. This technique breaks down words into smaller units, particularly valuable for handling rare words or complex vocabularies in large datasets.\n",
        "- **Edit Distance**: We introduced the concept of edit distance, a metric for measuring the similarity between two sequences of text. This measure finds applications in tasks like spell checking, machine translation evaluation, and identifying textual variations.\n",
        "\n",
        "By mastering these methods, you've gained the ability to clean, normalize, and analyze textual data effectively. This foundation empowers you to tackle more advanced NLP tasks and unlock the hidden treasures of meaning within language. Remember, the choice of technique depends on your specific NLP needs, and often a combination of these methods leads to optimal results.\n",
