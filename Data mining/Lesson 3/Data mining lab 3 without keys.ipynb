    "# Data Analysis Using Factor Analysis, PCA, and SVD\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "Learn to apply dimensionality reduction methods, such as Factor Analysis, PCA, and SVD, to analyze high-dimensional data. Understand how these methods uncover hidden structures and simplify data for better analysis and modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction methods such as Factor Analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) are essential in data analysis, especially when working with high-dimensional data. These methods help reduce the number of variables while preserving most of the information, making data easier to visualize and process. This lab focuses on implementing and understanding these techniques in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we will learn:\n",
    "- Applying PCA to reduce dimensionality and interpret components.\n",
    "- Using Factor Analysis to identify hidden factors in the data.\n",
    "- Applying SVD for data decomposition and analysis.\n",
    "- Evaluating the impact of dimensionality reduction on data and model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries that we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - a library for working with tabular data, which will help us in the data preparation phase.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) - for data visualization and identifying interesting patterns.\n",
    "- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - machine learning library for building and evaluating models.\n",
    "- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays\n"
