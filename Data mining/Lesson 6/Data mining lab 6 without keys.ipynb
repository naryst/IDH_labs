    "### **Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand the basics of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their applications.\n",
    "- Explore Reinforcement Learning (RL) concepts such as agents, rewards, and policies.\n",
    "- Implement GNNs for node classification on synthetic graph data.\n",
    "- Use RL to solve a graph traversal problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are emerging tools in modern machine learning. GNNs enable effective learning on graph-structured data, such as social networks, molecular structures, or transportation systems, while RL allows for decision-making through rewards in dynamic environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We will simulate graph data and train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to perform node classification.\n",
    "2) We will integrate Reinforcement Learning to train an agent to traverse a graph while maximizing cumulative rewards.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries that we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Torch](https://pytorch.org/) - for GNN implementation.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - for data visualization and identifying interesting patterns.\n",
    "- [networkx](https://networkx.org/) - for graph generation and visualization.\n",
    "- [gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) - for Reinforcement Learning environment.\n"
