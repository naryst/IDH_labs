    "### **Objective:**\n",
    "To learn and implement various clustering techniques for working with real data. Students will be able to understand how the algorithms divide data into clusters in different ways and where they can be applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is the task of dividing a set of objects into groups (clusters) so that objects within the same cluster are as similar to each other as possible, while objects from different clusters are different. In this lab activity, students will study several clustering methods to help them understand their applicability, features, and drawbacks. We will use several clustering algorithms such as KMeans, DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), hierarchical clustering, and the Girvan-Newman algorithm for working with graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Libraries that we use:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - a library for working with tabular data, which will help us in the data preparation phase.\n",
    "- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) - for data visualization and identifying interesting patterns.\n",
    "- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) - machine learning library for building and evaluating models.\n",
    "- [networkx](https://networkx.org/) - NetworkX is a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks."
