    "One of the strategies to improve user experience is to provide user with hints, or, otherwise, to autocomplete his queries. Let's consider 'suggest'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will practice generating suggestions using [Trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) data structure (prefix tree), see the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Trie** data structure is a tree-like data structure used for storing a dynamic set of strings. It is commonly used for efficient retrieval and storage of keys in a large dataset. The structure supports operations such as insertion, search, and deletion of keys, making it a valuable tool in fields like computer science and information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Trie consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node represents a character or a part of a string. The root node, the starting point of the Trie, represents an empty string. Each edge emanating from a node signifies a specific character. The path from the root to a node represents the prefix of a string stored in the Trie.\n",
